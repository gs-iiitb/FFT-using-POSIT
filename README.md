# FFT-using-POSIT
Fast Fourier Transform using POSIT
TO find the fft code one can go into /MY_test_POSIT/tests/posit, there we can find fft1.cpp and fft_test1.cpp
These are the code for the fft using posit.Just run the make command to compile and run the code.


 I have done some tweeks in the original fft code and I am attaching the results got from the same-
 
 
1) single precision fft code  


2) refined single precision code


3) double precision code


1) For single precision code I am attaching the whole file included with the code and the results drawn from the same with test1.txt and the folder name containing the whole code is "fft_single".


2)In the second case I have done some possible tweeks to improve the logerr got from the previous case.The whole folder conatining the codes and results can be founds with the name "fft_refsingle" and the result with name "test_f2d.txt" 


3) This is the double precision original source code with the folder name as "fftd" containing the source code and the results with the name "test1.txt"
